# Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing
Meet Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a visionary Hungarian physician born in 1818, who played a pivotal role in transforming medical practices at 
the Vienna General Hospital. Dive into the early 1840s, a time when childbed fever claimed the lives of up to 10% of women giving birth. 
Dr. Semmelweis, troubled by this alarming mortality rate, identified the culprit: contaminated hands of delivering doctors. In this GitHub repository, 
join us on a data analysis journey as we revisit the historical data that led Dr. Semmelweis to advocate for the simple yet revolutionary practice of 
handwashing. Explore the insights that changed the course of medical history and discover the significance of hygiene in healthcare through the lens of 
Dr. Semmelweis' groundbreaking work.
